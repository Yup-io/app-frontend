## Contribution Guidelines

### Component Definition & Refactoring
- ðŸš« For now, we have most components in their own directories.
- ðŸš« Some components include several components in one directory.
- âœ… We recommend defining one component in one separate directory inside `src/components`, including `ComponentName.js`, `index.js`, and `styles.js`.
    1. `ComponentName.js` will include the implementation of the component detail.
    2. `index.js` will export the component by default.
    3. `styles.js` will include styles definition using styled components.
- âœ… We strongly recommend defining new components as functional components.
- âœ… When someone works on refactoring a class component, we recommend converting it into functional component.

### Styling
- ðŸš« Most of the web app had been implemented using `Mui v4` and its styling system.
- âœ… We strongly recommend styling components using `Mui v5` styling system, which is using `emotion` or `sx` props.
